In this paper we propose a new approach to study the relative intensity noise RIN of Fabry-Pérot laser based on traveling wave model TWM. The intensity is modeled for both high and low frequency noise for different injection current. Numerical results of our modeling show an excellent agreement with the rate equations model in the calculation of RIN spectrum.
