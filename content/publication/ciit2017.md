In this paper, we compare and analysis the large signal transient response of Fabry-Pérot semiconductor laser using two different theoretical models: rate equations model and traveling wave model.  The results are obtained by numerical solution of these two models and compared in terms of physical properties of the laser and proposed simulation techniques, which they show clearly an excellent agreement."""
