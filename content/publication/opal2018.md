This paper investigates the static characteristics of a multiple-phase-shift (MPS) distributed feedback DFB semiconductor laser with a distributed coupling coefficient (DCC) based on modified split-step time-domain modeling (SS-TDM) used for solving the time-dependent coupled-wave equations of time domain traveling wave (TDTW) model. The simulation results show that both threshold current and the slope efficiency in both in the AR/AR and HR/LR coatings configurations vary significantly depending on structural parameter of the laser.
