In this paper, we present a novel approach to analyze Distributed Feedback semiconductor laser with weak external optical feedback. This approach is based on Time Domain Traveling Wave Model, which extends by introducing two new fields equations in time domain to include the deviation of the forward and backward traveling optical fields as a result of external feedback. Both static and dynamic characteristics with and without optical feedback are obtained and compared to other theoretical and experimental results and they clearly show a good agreement. Our results demonstrate that our model can serve as a promising tool in modeling and simulation of (DFB) semiconductor lasers with weak optical feedback.
