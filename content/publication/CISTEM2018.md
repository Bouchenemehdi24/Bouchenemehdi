In this paper, we present a rigorous approach based on split-step time-domain dynamic modeling (SS-TDM) algorithm using to solve the time-dependent coupled wave equations of the time-domain traveling-wave (TDTW) model to investigate the effect of facets reflectivity on the Light-Current characteristics of (DFB) semiconductor laser for different values the coupling coefficient. The simulation results show that using high reflection coating on the front facet and low reflection coating on the back facet with a proper diffraction grating can significantly improve the power-conversion efficiency of the (DFB) semiconductor laser.
